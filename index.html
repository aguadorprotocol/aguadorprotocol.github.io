A blockchain based water supply network would allow for real-time Water Accounting without the need for a trusted third party. We propose a novel solution to this problem composed of new oracular proofs.
Quantity
A mineral rights holder must trust an extractors report. For example: an extractor can compose a document asserting that it pumped 10 thousand barrels of oil out of the ground on behalf of a rights holder when in fact it actually pumped 13 thousand barrels and there is no way for the rights holder to validate the extractors assertion. Worse one is unable to tell if the discrepancy is the product of an accident, human error, or intentional. These problems mirror those found in single-entry bookkeeping which necessitated the advent of double-entry bookkeeping.
Even if you add mechanism of third party auditing it is possible for parties to collude say, a government office and a utility company, to deceive or defraud another party.
Quality/Character
Water consumers have no way of knowing or validating that they are receiving water of the character they expect, they have no way of knowing whether it be through, intention, negligence, or accident, if assertions made upstream are actually true. They also cannot reliably independently validate that they are getting the water that they are paying for.
Yet the technology exists for near real-time water metering and analysis.
Thereʼs no way to know if a record like a water bill is correct, and thereʼs no way for a consumer to know if the water they are drinking is safe. Consumers are forced to trust upstream parties. We propose a novel solution to these problems composed of new oracular proofs.

An aguador is a network node capable of communicating with other nodes and posting messages to the chain.
Attestations: aguadors are incentivized to post attestations Proof-of-Purification: a validated attestation of purity
Proof-of-Volume: a validated attestation of delivered water
Aguadors are rewarded both for their own PoPs as well as for processing the PoPs of the network.
  
An aguador can post a Proof-of-Purification asserting the character and volume of water flowing through it.
Downstream aguadors corroborate this PoP with their own PoPs after validating it.
The number of downchain corroboratory PoPs decreases the likelihood that a PoP is fraudulent.
The diversity of parties along the chain of a PoP decreases the likelihood that a PoP is fraudulent as parties with unaligned interests are disincentivized to collude and unlikely to do so successfully.
Likewise on the other hand if a node publishes a contestation or conflicting attestation one is able to identity where in the chain of flow an issue has occurred in real-time.
A water bill in this case is a (composite) proof that such water was delivered and a probabilistically reliable assertion of its character, in the same way a cryptocurrency transaction is its own cryptographic receipt and a proof of valid provenance.
Aguadors validate transactions according to rules encoding the behavior of water, as handled in deterministic and probabilistic water network analysis, into a constraint language where transactions which violate the physical laws are deemed invalid.
This will allow us to approach real-time actual water accounting, preventing waste, theft, damage, poisoning, and loss of life as well as reducing costs, and empowering network participants with new insights.
This necessitates a paradigm shift in culture where end-users, water consumers, are not merely clients served by water processors but rather are able to validate attestations about the character and quantity of water delivered to them as peers.
